# My Journey

After years in 3D printing and motion capture, I decided to pivot into cybersecurity. This post covers my transition and key learnings.

## Why Cybersecurity?

I've always been fascinated by how systems work under the hood. Breaking things (ethically) to understand them better felt like a natural progression.

## Key Resources

- HackTheBox for practical challenges
- TryHackMe for structured learning
- Building homelab for hands-on practice

## Next Steps

Currently focusing on:
- Web application security
- Network penetration testing
- Automation and scripting
