# Description
A detailed description of my Intelligent Productivity Assistant will appear here soon—a system utilizing AI, cutting-edge GPT-4o-mini-tts voice synthesis technology, and smart home automation to help me get into the right mindset every single day.

This project integrates Home Assistant, Notion, weather forecasts, and the GPT-4.1 LLM to fully automate the generation and playback of personalized voice briefings on my smart speaker. The system supports both morning wake-up routines and starting the workday—motivating, reminding about key routines, and listing current tasks for the day, all designed to enhance both productivity and a positive, comfortable start to every day.
